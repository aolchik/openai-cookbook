    "Searching for information can be challenging. We can leverage the completions API and embeddings to help us sift through the noise. In this notebook, we will use the completions API to generate search queries given a user's question, and then rerank the results using semantic similarity to a hypothetical answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "- User asks a question\n",
    "- Model generates a list of queries\n",
    "- Search queries are executed in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Re-rank**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model generates an ideal answer by hallucination\n",
    "- Search results are ranked based on semantic similarity to the ideal answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Answer**\n",
