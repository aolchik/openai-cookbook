# Welcome, AI Chef

The OpenAI Cookbook is a community-driven resource aimed at sharing knowledge in a way that is accessible, engaging, and enriching for everyone. To ensure the quality of submissions, we have established a rubric that assesses each contribution on various areas.

Each area is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. The purpose of this rating system is to maintain a high standard of quality, relevance, and uniqueness in all contributions. Contributions that score lower than a 3 in any of the areas will generally be rejected.

We encourage contributors to familiarize themselves with this rubric before writing content. Understanding the criteria not only increases the chances of your contribution being accepted, but also helps in creating a resource that is comprehensive, clear, and beneficial for all users.

For additional guidelines on writing good documentation, refer to [What Makes Documentation Good](https://cookbook.openai.com/what_makes_documentation_good).
